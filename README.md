# Heart Rate and Energy Monitoring App

## Overview

This is a lightweight app designed for Bangle.js that monitors heart rate, calculates cumulative energy expenditure in kilojoules (kJ), and alerts the user if energy output approaches a predefined threshold. The app offers a real-time display of data and incorporates interactive functionality to start/stop monitoring and dismiss warnings.

## Features
	1.	Heart Rate Monitoring:
	    •	Continuously tracks heart rate readings.
	    •	Filters and processes readings with a confidence level >50%.
	2.	Energy Calculation:
    	•	Estimates metabolic rate using gender, weight, and age.
    	•	Calculates and displays cumulative energy expenditure (kJ).
	3.	Warning System:
    	•	Issues a warning when energy expenditure nears a configurable threshold.
    	•	Displays a dismissible warning message.
	4.	Interactive Monitoring:
    	•	Starts/stops monitoring via button press.
    	•	Adjusts screen brightness dynamically during monitoring.
	5.	Customizable Parameters:
    	•	User-configurable weight, age, and gender.
    	•	Adjustable maximum energy (BTU) threshold.

## How It Works

### Key Functions:
	1.	calculateMetabolicRate(hr):
    	•	Computes the metabolic rate based on heart rate, gender, weight, and age.
	2.	updateCumulativeKJ():
    	•	Updates energy expenditure every 20 seconds.
    	•	Triggers a warning if energy approaches the maximum threshold.
	3.	onHeartRateReading(h):
    	•	Processes incoming heart rate readings.
    	•	Maintains a rolling 20-second data window.
	4.	redisplayData():
    	•	Updates the graphical display with the latest data.
	5.	Button Press Handling:
    	•	Toggles monitoring and adjusts display brightness.
    	•	Resets energy data when monitoring is stopped.

### Setup
	1.	Install on Bangle.js:
    	•	Upload the script (bangle.12.18.js) to your device using the [Espruino IDE](https://www.espruino.com/ide/).
    	•	The Espruino IDE is an online environment that simplifies uploading JavaScript code to Espruino devices. Access it here: Espruino IDE.
	2.	Configuration:
    	•	Modify config at the top of the script to set your:
    	•	Weight (kg)
    	•	Age
    	•	Gender (0 = female, 1 = male)
    	•	Adjust maxBTU if necessary (default is 5000 BTU).
	3.	Start Monitoring:
    	•	Press the designated button to start or stop monitoring.
    	•	The app initializes with a message prompting the user to start.

### Usage Instructions
	1.	Starting the App:
    	•	Upon running the script, the display will prompt: “Press Button to Start.”
    	•	Press the button to begin monitoring.
	2.	Monitoring:
    	•	The app will track your heart rate and update cumulative kJ burned.
    	•	Real-time data is displayed on the screen.
	3.	Warnings:
    	•	If energy output nears the set maximum threshold, a warning will appear.
    	•	Tap the screen to dismiss the warning and resume updates.
	4.	Stopping Monitoring:
    	•	Press the button again to stop monitoring.
    	•	The app will dim the screen and reset energy data.

### Customization
	  • 	To adapt the app to your needs:
    	•	Update Interval: Modify updateInterval to adjust the refresh rate (default is 20 seconds).
    	•	Maximum Energy Threshold: Change maxBTU to set a new limit.
    	•	Brightness Settings: Adjust Bangle.setLCDBrightness() values to suit your preferences.

### Technical Details
    	•	Heart Rate Data:
    	•	Collected via Bangle.js’s HRM (Heart Rate Monitor) event.
    	•	Data points are stored for the past 20 seconds to calculate averages.
    	•	Energy Conversion:
    	•	Uses kilojoules (kJ) as the unit of energy.
    	•	Converts BTU to kJ for warning thresholds (1 BTU ≈ 1.055 kJ).

### Known Limitations
    	•	Heart Rate Confidence:
    	•	Relies on readings with confidence >50%. Inconsistent readings may affect calculations.
    	•	Threshold Warnings:
    	•	Users should ensure the maxBTU value is set appropriately to avoid false alerts.

### Future Improvements
    	•	User interface enhancements for better usability.
    	•	Option for users to adjust configurations directly on the device.
    	•	Additional metrics (e.g., calories, steps).
